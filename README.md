# Excel-Projects
A collection of excel projects that I have completed.

The first project titled "Billionaire Statistics.xlsx" takes a look at all of the billionaires in the world and their characteristics. This data allowed me to create a dashboard where visuals are used to identify the richest people in the world. These charts are able to be filtered by many different characteristics such as gender, industry, country, and if the billionaire is self-made or not.

The second project titled "Excel Bike Sales Project Dataset.xlsx"
