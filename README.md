# Excel-Projects
A collection of excel projects that I have completed.

The first project titled "Billionaire Statistics.xlsx" takes a look at all of the billionaires in the world and their characteristics. This data allowed me to create a dashboard where visuals are used to identify the richest people in the world. These charts are able to be filtered by many different characteristics such as gender, industry, country, and if the billionaire is self-made or not.

The second project titled "Excel Bike Sales Project Dataset.xlsx" takes a look at the inquiries a bike shop had received from potential customers, the data provides many different characteristics of each customer such as their commute distance, highest completed level of education, marital status, and much more. This data was used to create a dashboard where I provided many visuals to find patterns and sales data among customers who did/didn't make purchases and their characteristics.
